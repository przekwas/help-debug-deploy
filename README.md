## Next.js and Tailwind CSS Blog

I built this blog using a tutorial from Daily Tuition on YouTube. I added a few features of my own including selectors for random authors and related posters for each article. I also used an emoji downloaded from favicon.io for this site's favicon.

If you'd like to build one just like this, follow along with his tutorial here: https://bit.ly/3yK3rSR
